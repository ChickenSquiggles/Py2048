# Py2048
This is a recreation of 2048 in Python 3.11.0
For this project, PyGame was used.

# Installation
In order to run this, pygame needs to be installed in path.
The python code does auto install pygame, but if you are not on windows, delete lines 3-9, and install pygame manually.

If you are on python 3.11.0 (newest), when this project was made, pygame is not yet supported. Run the command "pip install pygame --pre" to install pygame.
